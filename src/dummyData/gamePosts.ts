            "name": "Did anyone else think killing Floyd and Debra was just … unnecessary?",
            "text": "<p>Honestly, this is one of the plots in the story that I really disliked and made me look at Trevor a little differently, because Floyd never hurt Trevor, agreed to let him and Wade just stay with him in his girlfriend&#8217;s apartment for a long time whilst knowing Debra wouldn&#8217;t like visitors and she would be really angry at him if she found out. Besides, even if Debra was definitely not very nice I still don&#8217;t think she deserved to be killed as she was rightfully probably freaked out by Trevor just bursting into their appartement and causing a scene. It was just super unnecessary imo, and especially twisted because Trevor lied to Wade and had him believe Floyd and Debra were still alive afterwards. Not to mention that it&#8217;s implied multiple times that Trevor did some disturbing things to Floyd whilst staying with him initially.</p><p>I know Trevor is an unhinged character and he&#8217;s done worse things, but this just really put me off for some reason. Besides, I really liked the Vespucci Beach condo as a safehouse for the location and especially the interior, and I wish we could have kept it instead of having Trevor suddenly move to the Vanilla Unicorn and now have an office as a second safehouse (how random). But regardless, I wish he at least didn&#8217;t kill Floyd and Debra. (even if it&#8217;s implied on the in-game news it was actually Debra that shot Floyd and Trevor proceeded to kill her afterwards interestingly, but it still escalated because of Trevor just bursting in)</p><p>I know it&#8217;s unlikely Floyd and Debra would have let Trevor and Wade stay with them forever, but idk they could have at least found something that didn&#8217;t end in their death. Trevor could have simply picked up Wade and took him to the Vanilla Unicorn without that entire confrontation or maybe magically Floyd and/or Debra would have a change of heart if Trevor proved himself to be a reliable housemate to them.</p><p>What are your thoughts on this mission? Do you agree? Or did you think this actually fitted Trevor&#8217;s character?</p>",

            "name": "Was it intended for Michael to discover that Jimmy and Tracey were not his kids?",
            "text": "<p>A lot of things have always bugged me about Michael's family, and I think that Rockstar may have been laying some groundwork to prove that Michael's children were not his. Here's why I believe this....</p><p>1) When Amanda's drunk, she'll tell Michael she didn't like him at first and was interested in \"the other guy\" he was with. It's also revealed in hangouts that she got pregnant with Tracey almost immediately after she met Michael and was also working as a hooker at the time.</p><p>2) Amanda doesn't answer the question when Michael asks if she ever slept with Trevor, but says \"I feel sick\". If she did sleep with him, at what point did it happen if she and Michael got together so quickly due to the pregnancy?</p><p>3) When you play tennis as Trevor with Amanda, it's strongly implied something sexual happened between them at some point.</p><p>4) Has anyone ever noticed how in the painting of the kids in Michael's living room, Jimmy looks remarkably similar to Brad in terms of his hair colour and style?</p><p>5) Michael himself even questions if the kids are his own, and Tracey will say she wishes Trevor was her father.</p><p>6) If you call Jimmy up as Trevor on the drive to the airfield to get to North Yankton, Trevor tells Jimmy he's always doubted if Michael was his dad. Trevor also digs at lot at Michael about being a father and when he reminds him of Amanda's past with prostitution Michael gets really pissy!</p><p>6) Rarely do fictional families ever have similar appearance due to casting limitations, but those kids look nothing like Michael. Surely the animation department could have worked on it and improved the family resemblance a little bit, if one was intended?</p><p>7) Tracey's personality is a lot like Trevor's. She's into drugs and alcohol, she does a lot of stuff to make Michael's life harder. She's happy to threaten to have her own mother killed in the very first scene she's in, which seems very \"Trevor\" to me haha! She loves attention and is kind of \"flighty\" in a similar way to how Trevor is constantly into something or someone's business, darting from one big drama to the next.</p><p>8) Jimmy is a hell of a lot like Lester when you break it down, Michael even says so himself when you're trailing the janitor guy in the FIB raid set up. They're both slightly overweight, both have issues in terms of health and socializing, they're both tropey \"shut-in gamers\". They both have absolutely no tolerance for Michael's bullsh<em>t and will back talk him like there's no tomorrow, and both of them like starting sh</em>t online too.</p><p>9) Tracey is a natural blonde by the looks of it from the old pictures in the De Santa house, and obviously that's nothing conclusive but it's what originally lead me to wonder about all this....</p><p>The way Michael gets his family back together felt so rushed to me, so I've always wondered if Rockstar intended to do more with that element. I think it seems like they laid a few clues to potentially expand on who was their real daddy in some way, but probably changed their mind because it would be so grim to find out for sure that the kids aren't Michael's and undoubtedly it would have sent him into a tailspin of depression and violent behaviour which the tone and length of the game didn't really allow for.</p><p>Anyway, just a theory that's something a bit different to the whole Chiliad thing or if we're ever going to see story DLC haha!</p>",
